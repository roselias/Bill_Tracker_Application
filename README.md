Project created for UHD's Human-Computer Interaction Summer Course. Written in Java and implementing SQLite. 
The purpose of this project was to design and prototype an application that incorporated HCI design paradigms. 

The app I designed was a simple bill payment tracking system for users who would like to track the due dates and payments made of their bills and subscriptions. 
Upon opening the application, the user would see a calendar with highlighted days of the month, and below a list that contains all the bills they have. This home page would make it easy for the user to see what bills they have upcoming and be able to make them on time. From the home page, they would click on the menu button in the bottom right and see a selection of menu items. The menu items would be: Add Bill, Add Payment, Delete Bill, View Payment History.

Due to the time constraint of the summer course (less than 5 weeks), only the bare bones of the application was created. 

Archiving project to preserve original code submitted to complete assignment.
